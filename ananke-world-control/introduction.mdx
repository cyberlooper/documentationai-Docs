# Ananke World Control

Ananke WorldControl (AWC) is a lightweight server-control plugin for Paper/Spigot-style servers.

## Capabilities

It lets you *allow or block* specific world mechanics at runtime:

- Environment rules (fire spread, weather, leaf decay, ice/snow behavior, etc.)
- Physics and fluids (block physics, gravity blocks, fluid mixing, waterlogging, bubble columns)
- Mob spawning and mob griefing
- Explosions (TNT, creeper, wither, bed/anchor)
- Player survival mechanics (fall damage, hunger loss, natural regen, void protection)
- Per-block restrictions (disable placing/breaking/interacting with specific blocks)
- Crafting restrictions (disable crafting specific items)
- Dimension controls (Nether/End access, Nether roof prevention)
- Optional custom-block restrictions (ItemsAdder/Oraxen/Nexo + PDC based)

## Requirements

- **Minecraft server**: Bukkit/Paper/Purpur/Spigot
- **Minecraft version**: 1.21.x (`api-version: "1.21"`)
- **Permissions plugin**: optional but recommended for managing bypass/admin nodes
