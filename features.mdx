## Wiki Management

You start by creating dedicated wiki spaces for each plugin. OlympiTech supports nested pages, tags, and search indexing to keep documentation organized.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Wiki" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your plugin dashboard and select "New Wiki". Enter a name like "EssentialsX Documentation".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-text">
    Use the page editor to write in MDX. Add frontmatter for metadata:
    
````yaml
---
title: Installation Guide
description: Step-by-step setup for EssentialsX
tags: ["setup", "beginner"]
---
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Organize Structure" icon="folder">
    Drag pages into hierarchies. Create sections like `/commands`, `/configuration`, and `/faq`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use tags like `["setup", "advanced"]` for better search and filtering across your wiki.
</Callout>

## Version Control and Update Tracking

Maintain clean documentation histories with built-in version control. You publish updates tied to plugin releases, and readers always see the right version.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Plugin Changelog" icon="git-commit">
    Integrate changelogs directly into your wiki:
    
    <CodeGroup tabs="YAML,JSON">
    ````yaml
    versions:
      - version: "2.20.0"
        date: "2024-10-15"
        changes:
          - "Added `/home` command"
          - "Fixed permission bugs"
    ````
    ````json
    {
      "versions": [{
        "version": "2.20.0",
        "date": "2024-10-15",
        "changes": ["Added /home command", "Fixed permission bugs"]
      }]
    }
    ````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rollback" icon="undo">
    Select any version from the history dropdown to view or restore older docs.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Community Contribution Tools
