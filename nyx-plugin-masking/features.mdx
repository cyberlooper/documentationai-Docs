# Nyx Features

Protecting sensitive information in chat and logs.

## 🎭 Data Masking

Hide secrets automatically.

### What is it?
Nyx (the Goddess of Night) puts a "mask" over sensitive text so nobody can read it.

### How it works
The plugin watches for things that look like secrets, such as:
- **IP Addresses**: `192.168.1.1` becomes `***.***.***.***`
- **Emails**: `steve@minecraft.com` becomes `*****@*********.***`
- **Phone Numbers**: `555-0199` becomes `***-****`
- **Credit Cards**: `1234-5678-9012-3456` becomes `****-****-****-****`

### Why use it?
- **Privacy**: Protects players from accidentally leaking their personal info in public chat.
- **Safety**: Prevents "doxxing" (maliciously sharing someone's address).
- **Compliance**: Helps server logs meet privacy rules (like GDPR) by not storing personal data forever.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You decide what to hide.

### What is it?
You can create your own "patterns" (using Regex) to hide anything you want.

### Examples
- Hide **Curse Words**: Use it as a simple chat filter.
- Hide **Server Names**: Stop people from advertising other servers (e.g., `play.otherserver.com`).
- Hide **Admin Codes**: If you have secret codes for staff, mask them so regular players can't see them.
