## `ban-reasons`

This is the core of the plugin. Each key under `ban-reasons` defines a preset reason you can use with `/punish <player> <key>`.

Each reason supports:

- **`duration`** (string)
  - Parsed by `DurationParser`.
  - Supports: `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w` (seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks).
  - Chained values like `1h30m`.
  - Special value: `perma` => permanent.
- **`punishmentType`** (string): `ban`, `mute`, `prison` (case-insensitive).
- **`inventoryClear`** (bool): If true, clears the player’s inventory when banned.
- **`reason`** (string): Display reason.
- **`customReason`** (string): If set, this becomes the displayed reason.
- **`permission`** (string)
  - Controls who can use this specific reason.
  - `admin`, `moderator`, `helper`, or a direct permission node.

Example:

```yaml
ban-reasons:
  spam:
    duration: 12h
    customReason: ""
    permission: helper
    # Scaling Options (Optional)
    mode: "default" # "default", "linear", or "fractal"

  # Linear Mode
  # "Three Strikes" style: After N offenses, apply a specific punishment.
  spam:
    mode: "linear"
    linear-threshold: 3      # After 3 offenses...
    linear-action: "ban"     # ...perform this action...
    linear-duration: "24h"   # ...for this duration.

  # Fractal Mode
  # A custom ladder of specific punishments for each offense.
  swearing:
    mode: "fractal"
    steps:
      - ["mute", "1h"]   # 1st Offense
      - ["mute", "12h"]  # 2nd Offense
      - ["ban", "3d"]    # 3rd Offense
      - ["ban", "perma"] # 4th Offense
```

## `ban-message`

Controls the kick/deny screen the user sees when banned.

```yaml
ban-message:
  lines:
    - text: "You are banned from this server!"
      color: red
    - "&7Reason: &f{reason}"
    - "&7Duration: &f{duration}"
    - "&7Banned by: &f{banner}"
  inventory-cleared-line:
    text: "Your inventory has been cleared."
    color: red
```

## `screenshare`

Controls screenshare behavior.

- **`screenshare.timeout-minutes`** (int)
- **`screenshare.message`** (string)
- **`screenshare.reject`**: Defines the special punishment applied if the player logs out during a screenshare.

## `prison.location`

This is written automatically by `/setprison`. If not set, imprisoning will still store the record, but players might not be teleported anywhere.
