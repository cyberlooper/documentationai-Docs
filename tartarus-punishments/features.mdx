# Tartarus Features

A simple guide to the punishment system.

## 🔨 Bans & Mutes

The basics of keeping bad actors away.

### What is it?
- **Ban**: Stops a player from joining the server.
- **Mute**: Stops a player from chatting or using commands.

### How it works
- **IP Bans**: If you ban a player, the plugin also remembers their IP address. If they try to join on an "alt" account from the same house, they are blocked too.
- **Duration**: You can ban someone for `10m` (10 minutes), `5d` (5 days), or `perma` (forever).

## ⛓️ The Prison

A time-out corner for players acting up.

### What is it?
Instead of kicking them off the server, you lock them in a jail cell.

### How it works
1. Admin runs `/prison <player> 10m`.
2. The player is teleported to the jail cell (set with `/setprison`).
3. They are **Frozen**! They cannot move, jump, or break blocks.
4. They just have to sit there and think about what they did.
5. When the time is up, they are automatically teleported back to where they were.

## 🖥️ Screenshare Checks

Freeze a suspicious player for inspection.

### What is it?
If you think someone is cheating (x-ray, fly hacks), you can freeze them to check their computer (over Discord screenshare, usually).

### How it works
1. Admin runs `/screenshare <player>`.
2. The player is frozen and sees a big message: "You are being checked. Join Discord."
3. **The Trap**: If they panic and disconnect (log out) while frozen, the system **automatically bans them**. This catches cheaters who try to run away!

## 📈 Punishment Scaling

Automated discipline that gets stricter every time.

### What is it?
The plugin remembers a criminal record for every player. If they break the rules again, the punishment gets worse automatically.

### Modes

#### 1. "Three Strikes" (Global Linear)
- **Strike 1**: You get warned.
- **Strike 2**: You get muted.
- **Strike 3**: You get banned!
*(You set the number of strikes and the final punishment).*

#### 2. The Ladder (Fractal Mode)
For specific rules (like "Swearing"), you can set a ladder of punishments:
- **1st Offense**: 1 hour Mute.
- **2nd Offense**: 1 day Mute.
- **3rd Offense**: 1 week Ban.
- **4th Offense**: Permanent Ban.

The plugin tracks this *per player, per reason*. So being muted for spamming won't make your "x-raying" status worse.

## 🔗 Cross-Ban (JanusMCD Integration)

Banning one account bans them all.

### What is it?
If you have **JanusMCD** installed and players have linked their Discord accounts:
- Banning `PlayerA` will verify who they are on Discord.
- It sees that `PlayerB` is also linked to that same Discord account.
- **Both** `PlayerA` and `PlayerB` are banned instantly.
