## Punishment Scaling

Tartarus Punishments supports three powerful scaling modes to automate discipline:

### 1. Global Linear Scaling
- **Disabled by default**.
- A "Three Strikes" style system.
- Every time a player receives **any** punishment, their global strike count increases.
- If they hit the `threshold`, the configured `action` is applied.

### 2. Linear Mode (Per Reason)
- Configured inside a specific `ban-reason` (e.g. `mode: linear`).
- Counts how many times the player has been punished for *this specific reason*.
- If they hit the `linear-threshold`, the `linear-action` is applied.

### 3. Fractal Mode (Per Reason)
- Configured inside a specific `ban-reason` (e.g. `mode: fractal`).
- Defines a list of `steps` (ladder).
- Example:
    - Step 1: 1 hour Mute
    - Step 2: 12 hour Mute
    - Step 3: 7 day Ban
    - Step 4: Permanent Ban
- The plugin automatically applies the next step in the ladder.

## Integrations

### JanusMCD
Tartarus Punishments automatically detects if **JanusMCD** is installed.
- It registers a **Ban Checker** with JanusMCD.
- If you use JanusMCD's "Linked Accounts" feature, banning one account via Tartarus will automatically prevent all other linked accounts from joining usage.
