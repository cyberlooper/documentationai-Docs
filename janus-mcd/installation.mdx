## Server Owners

1. Drop the JanusMCD jar into `plugins/`.
2. Start the server once to generate configs under `plugins/JanusMCD/`.
3. Edit your live configs in `plugins/JanusMCD/*.yml` (the files in `src/main/resources/` are only defaults bundled in the jar).
4. Set `discord-token` and at least one entry in `channel-ids`.
5. Restart the server (or use `/janusmcd reload` for supported hot-reload items).

## Startup sequence

- `JanusMCD#onEnable()` initializes:
  - `DebugManager`
  - `ConfigManager` (loads multiple YAMLs and can watch for file changes)
  - `DatabaseManager`
  - Feature managers (account linking, auth, freeze, vanish, advancements, death messages, etc.)
  - `DiscordManager` which boots JDA asynchronously.
