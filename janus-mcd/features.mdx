# JanusMCD Features

This guide explains every feature in JanusMCD in simple terms.

## 🔗 Account Linking

Connect your Minecraft player to your Discord user.

### What is it?
This allows the server to know *who you are* on Discord when you are playing Minecraft, and vice-versa.

### Why use it?
- **Sync your identity**: Your Discord name and avatar can appear in Minecraft chat.
- **Security**: Server owners can require you to change your password or verify your location if you login from a weird place.
- **Cross-Ban**: If you get banned on one account, all your other linked accounts can be banned too.

### How it works
1. You type `/link` in Minecraft.
2. The bot sends you a code.
3. You DM the code to the bot on Discord (or use `/link` in Discord).
4. Done! You are linked.

### New: Linked Account Enforcement
JanusMCD can now enforce bans across all linked accounts. If a player has multiple Minecraft accounts linked to the same Discord ID, and one of them is banned (via **Tartarus Punishments** or the native ban system), **ALL** of them will be prevented from joining.

### Security
Admins can check the link status of any player using `/link status <user/uuid/name>`, which reveals all accounts connected to a single Digital identity.

## 🚫 Ban Synchronization

Synchronize bans between your Minecraft Server and Discord Guild.

### Discord -> Minecraft
If a user is banned on your Discord server:
- **Real-Time**: If they are online in Minecraft, they are immediately kicked and banned.
- **Offline Reconciliation**: If they were offline during the ban, the next time they try to join, JanusMCD checks their Discord status. If they are banned on Discord, they are denied entry.
- **Unban Sync**: If you unban them on Discord, they are automatically unbanned in Minecraft.

### Minecraft -> Discord
If a player is banned in Minecraft (and is linked):
- The bot finds their Discord account and bans them from the Discord server.
- The reason is synced: "Synced Ban: [Minecraft Reason]".

## 🎙️ Proximity Voice Chat

Talk to nearby players using Discord Voice.

### What is it?
It automatically moves you into a Discord voice channel with the people standing near you in the game.

### How it works
1. Join the **"Lobby"** voice channel in Discord.
2. Walk close to another player in-game.
3. The bot **drags** both of you into a private "Voice Group" channel.
4. Walk away, and the bot moves you back to the lobby or into a new group.

> **Note:** You don't need to install any mods on your computer. It just uses standard Discord.

## 👻 Stealth Vanish

Become completely invisible to moderate the server.

### What is it?
A super-powered "invisibility potion" for admins. When you are vanished, standard players cannot see you, tab-complete your name, or know you are online.

### Features
- **True Invisibility**: You don't send any data to other players. Hacked clients cannot see you.
- **Silent Chests**: Open chests without the lid moving or making a sound.
- **Fake Logout**: When you vanish, it can say "Player left the game" so people think you are gone.

## 📊 Server Reports

Get a quick health check of your server.

### What is it?
A command (`/report`) that builds a colorful graph and list of numbers to show how popular your server is.

### The Numbers Explained

| Metric | What it means |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DAU** (Daily Active Users) | How many unique humans played **today**. |
| **MAU** (Monthly Active Users) | How many unique humans played **this month**. |
| **Conversion** | What % of your players have linked their Discord account. High is good! |
| **Retention** | What % of new players **came back** the next day. If this is low, your server might be boring for new players. |
| **Avg Session** | How long the average player stays online before quitting. |

## 📢 Status Embeds & Alerts

### Status Embeds
A live "Server Status" billboard in Discord. It updates every minute to show:
- 🟢 **Online** / 🔴 **Offline** status.
- **TPS** (Server Performance).
- **Player Count** & List (with linked Discord tags!).

### Custom Event Alerts
JanusMCD can now monitor **any** Bukkit event.
- **Example**: Admin wants to know when a player kills a specific mob or triggers a specific plugin event.
- You can configure this in the config to send an alert to a specific Discord channel when that event happens.

---

## 🏆 Advancement Notifications

Show off your achievements in Discord.

### What is it?
When a player gets an advancement (like "Diamonds!" or "The End?"), the bot posts a message in Discord.

### Customization
- **Colors**: Different colors for Tasks (Blue), Goals (Green), and Challenges (Orange).
- **Icons**: Adds emojis based on the type of advancement (🔥 for Nether, 🌲 for Husbandry).

## 💬 Chat Relay & Smart Filtering

Connects Minecraft Chat to Discord Chat with safety in mind.

### Smart Filtering
The filtering engine has been completely overhauled to be smarter than standard "banned word" lists.

- **Leetspeak Decoder**: It reads "h4ck3r" as "hacker" and "w0rd" as "word".
- **Strict vs. Smart Boundaries**:
  - *Strict*: Blocks specific independent words (e.g. "bad") but allows them inside others (e.g. "superbad" might be allowed if configured).
  - *Smart Phrases*: Can detect multi-word phrases like "bad phrase".
- **URL Blocking**: Automatically scrubs links from chat to prevent advertising spam.
