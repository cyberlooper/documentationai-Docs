## Proximity Voice Chat

**How it works:**
1. Players join the **Lobby Channel** in Discord (configured in `voice.yml`).
2. JanusMCD tracks their in-game location.
3. If players are within `proximity-radius` of each other, the bot **automatically** moves them into a temporary **Voice Group** channel.
4. When they move apart, they are returned to the Lobby or reassigned to new groups.

**Note**: This feature is entirely automated. There are no in-game commands for players to run.

## Stealth Vanish

JanusMCD uses **ProtocolLib** for deep stealth integration. This provides true invisibility at the packet level.

**Capabilities**:
- **Entity Hiding**: You are completely invisible to clients.
- **Silent Chests**: Opening chests/barrels/shulkers while vanished does NOT trigger opening animations or sounds for other players.
- **Tab-Complete Protection**: Vanished players are removed from tab-complete lists.
- **Server List Suppression**: Vanished players are hidden from the server list player count/hover.

## Account Linking

- Players can link their Discord account to their Minecraft account via a DM-based verification flow.
- Supports enforcing a limit on links per Discord account (e.g. max 1 or 3).
- Verification codes expire after a configured time.
- Logging webhooks track link creations/removals.

## SkinsRestorer Integration

**Q: My server is in Offline/Cracked mode. Will heads work in webhooks?**
A: **Yes**, fully supported via **SkinsRestorer**.
- JanusMCD detects SkinsRestorer (v14 and v15+) automatically.
- It uses the player's *Skin Name* (set via `/skin`) to fetch the avatar, ensuring the webhook matches their visual appearance, not their Steve/Alex UUID.
- Default `avatar-url` templates (e.g., `mc-heads.net`) support this out of the box.

## Server Reports

The `/report` command generates a visual health check for your server. It tracks key metrics to help you understand player engagement and retention.

### Metrics Explained

| Metric | Full Name | What it means |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DAU** | Daily Active Users | The number of unique players who joined the server in the last **24 hours**. This shows your immediate daily traffic. |
| **MAU** | Monthly Active Users | The number of unique players who joined in the last **30 days**. This indicates your overall active player base size. |
| **Conversion** | Link Conversion Rate | The percentage of your **total player interactions** that have linked their Discord account. <br>*(Formula: Total Linked Accounts / Total Unique Visitors)*.<br>A high conversion rate means effective onboarding to your Discord community. |
| **Retention** | Player Retention (Day 1 / 7) | The percentage of new players who **returned** to play again after a specific time.<br>- **Day 1**: Players who joined yesterday and came back today.<br>- **Day 7**: Players who joined a week ago and are playing today.<br>Higher retention means players are enjoying the server enough to stick around. |
| **Avg Session** | Average Session Length | The average amount of time a player spends on the server in a single sitting (calculated over the last 7 days). |

### Using this Data

- **Low Day 1 Retention?** Players might be confused or bored during their first impression. Check your spawn and tutorial.
- **Low Conversion?** Players aren't linking their accounts. Consider adding incentives or making the linking process more visible.
- **High MAU but Low DAU?** You have many players, but they don't play often. Events might help bring them back more frequently.
