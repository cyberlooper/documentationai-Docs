# JanusMCD Features

This guide explains every feature in JanusMCD in simple terms.

## 🔗 Account Linking

Connect your Minecraft player to your Discord user.

### What is it?
This allows the server to know *who you are* on Discord when you are playing Minecraft, and vice-versa.

### Why use it?
- **Sync your identity**: Your Discord name and avatar can appear in Minecraft chat.
- **Security**: Server owners can require you to change your password or verify your location if you login from a weird place.
- **Cross-Ban**: If you get banned on one account, all your other linked accounts can be banned too.

### How it works
1. You type `/link` in Minecraft.
2. The bot sends you a code.
3. You DM the code to the bot on Discord.
4. Done! You are linked.

## 🎙️ Proximity Voice Chat

Talk to nearby players using Discord Voice.

### What is it?
It automatically moves you into a Discord voice channel with the people standing near you in the game.

### How it works
1. Join the **"Lobby"** voice channel in Discord.
2. Walk close to another player in-game.
3. The bot **drags** both of you into a private "Voice Group" channel.
4. Walk away, and the bot moves you back to the lobby or into a new group.

> **Note:** You don't need to install any mods on your computer. It just uses standard Discord.

## 👻 Stealth Vanish

Become completely invisible to moderate the server.

### What is it?
A super-powered "invisibility potion" for admins. When you are vanished, standard players cannot see you, tab-complete your name, or know you are online.

### Features
- **True Invisibility**: You don't send any data to other players. Hacked clients cannot see you.
- **Silent Chests**: Open chests without the lid moving or making a sound.
- **Fake Logout**: When you vanish, it can say "Player left the game" so people think you are gone.

## 📊 Server Reports

Get a quick health check of your server.

### What is it?
A command (`/report`) that builds a colorful graph and list of numbers to show how popular your server is.

### The Numbers Explained

| Metric | What it means |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DAU** (Daily Active Users) | How many unique humans played **today**. |
| **MAU** (Monthly Active Users) | How many unique humans played **this month**. |
| **Conversion** | What % of your players have linked their Discord account. High is good! |
| **Retention** | What % of new players **came back** the next day. If this is low, your server might be boring for new players. |
| **Avg Session** | How long the average player stays online before quitting. |

## 📢 Status Embeds

A live "Server Status" billboard in Discord.

### What is it?
A message in a Discord channel that **updates itself** every minute. It never creates spam; it just edits the same message forever.

### What it shows
- **Status**: 🟢 Online / 🔴 Offline
- **Uptime**: How long the server has been running (e.g., "4d 12h").
- **TPS**: "Ticks Per Second". A measure of server lag. (20.00 is perfect).
- **Player List**: Shows who is online. If they are linked, it shows their Discord tag too!

## 🏆 Advancement Notifications

Show off your achievements in Discord.

### What is it?
When a player gets an advancement (like "Diamonds!" or "The End?"), the bot posts a message in Discord.

### Customization
- **Colors**: Different colors for Tasks (Blue), Goals (Green), and Challenges (Orange).
- **Icons**: Adds emojis based on the type of advancement (🔥 for Nether, 🌲 for Husbandry).

## 💬 Chat Relay & Filtering

Connects Minecraft Chat to Discord Chat.

### What is it?
- **Minecraft -> Discord**: Your in-game chat appears in a Discord channel.
- **Discord -> Minecraft**: Messages typed in Discord appear in-game.

### Smart Filtering
The bot uses a "Leetspeak Decoder" to catch bad words even if people try to hide them.
- `b4d w0rd` -> Detected as "bad word".
- `vvord` -> Detected as "word".
