## Proximity Voice Chat

**How it works:**
1. Players join the **Lobby Channel** in Discord (configured in `voice.yml`).
2. JanusMCD tracks their in-game location.
3. If players are within `proximity-radius` of each other, the bot **automatically** moves them into a temporary **Voice Group** channel.
4. When they move apart, they are returned to the Lobby or reassigned to new groups.

**Note**: This feature is entirely automated. There are no in-game commands for players to run.

## Stealth Vanish

JanusMCD uses **ProtocolLib** for deep stealth integration. This provides true invisibility at the packet level.

**Capabilities**:
- **Entity Hiding**: You are completely invisible to clients.
- **Silent Chests**: Opening chests/barrels/shulkers while vanished does NOT trigger opening animations or sounds for other players.
- **Tab-Complete Protection**: Vanished players are removed from tab-complete lists.
- **Server List Suppression**: Vanished players are hidden from the server list player count/hover.

## Account Linking

- Players can link their Discord account to their Minecraft account via a DM-based verification flow.
- Supports enforcing a limit on links per Discord account (e.g. max 1 or 3).
- Verification codes expire after a configured time.
- Logging webhooks track link creations/removals.

## SkinsRestorer Integration

**Q: My server is in Offline/Cracked mode. Will heads work in webhooks?**
A: **Yes**, fully supported via **SkinsRestorer**.
- JanusMCD detects SkinsRestorer (v14 and v15+) automatically.
- It uses the player's *Skin Name* (set via `/skin`) to fetch the avatar, ensuring the webhook matches their visual appearance, not their Steve/Alex UUID.
- Default `avatar-url` templates (e.g., `mc-heads.net`) support this out of the box.
