---

1. Place the jar in your server `plugins/` folder.
2. Start/restart the server.
3. Edit `plugins/TartarusPunishments/config.yml` to match your rules.
4. Set the prison location in-game (recommended):
   - `/setprison`

## How it works (Mental Model)

### Startup

On enable (`tartarus.punishments.Punishments#onEnable`):

- Loads and potentially auto-migrates config defaults (`ConfigManager#loadConfig`)
- Initializes `DatabaseManager` (SQLite + schema migrations)
- Initializes:
  - `FreezeManager` (prison/screen-share freeze mechanics)
  - `PlayerJoinListener` (ban checks + applying prison state on join)
  - `ScreenshareManager` (screenshare state tracking + reject ban)
  - `MuteListener` (chat/command blocking)
- Registers commands and listeners

### Where punishment data lives

- **Persistent state**: SQLite file at `plugins/TartarusPunishments/bans.db`
  - Primary tables:
    - `bans` (stores all punishment types: ban/mute/prison)
    - `ip_bans` (optional IP bans)
    - `last_seen_ip` (tracks last IP for offline bans)
