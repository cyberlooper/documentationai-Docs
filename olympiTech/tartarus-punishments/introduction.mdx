# Tartarus Punishments

Tartarus Punishments is a lightweight punishment plugin for Bukkit/Paper/Purpur/Spigot servers.

## Overview

It focuses on a simple workflow:

- You define **reason presets** in `config.yml` (duration, punishment type, staff permission level, inventory clearing)
- Staff run commands like `/punish`, `/forgive`, `/prison`, `/screenshare`
- The plugin stores punishment state in a local SQLite database (`plugins/TartarusPunishments/bans.db`)
- Players are blocked/kicked at the right times (pre-login ban checks, mute checks, prison freeze)

## Punishment Types

- **BAN** (UUID ban + optional IP ban)
- **MUTE** (blocks chat + command usage; only used if you define a reason preset with `punishmentType: mute`)
- **PRISON** (teleport + freeze + return location)
- **Screenshare** (freezes a player and automatically bans them if they log out during the screenshare)

## Requirements

- **Minecraft server**: Bukkit/Paper/Purpur/Spigot
- **Minecraft version**: 1.21.x (plugin `api-version: 1.21`)
- **Java**: 21+
